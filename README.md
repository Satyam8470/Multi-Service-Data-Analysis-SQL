# Multi-Service-Data-Analysis-SQL
"Advanced SQL project analyzing service usage and payment patterns to identify revenue growth and financial discrepancies. Built with PostgreSQL."
Multi-Service Platform Data Analysis (SQL)
Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis of a fictional multi-service platform. Using PostgreSQL, I have analyzed user behavior, service performance, and financial risks. The project demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into business-ready insights.

Note on Originality: > 🛡️ 100% Original Work: This project is built entirely from scratch. I have personally designed the database schema, handled data cleaning, and authored all SQL queries. This is not a copied or "follow-along" tutorial project; it reflects my independent problem-solving approach and technical skills.

Project Structure
📁 Data: Contains 4 CSV files (Users, Services, Usage, Payments).

📁 SQL_Queries: The main .sql script with all analysis queries.

📁 Reports: A human-friendly project report and a list of business questions.

Key Business Questions Addressed
Phase 1 (Basics): Overall revenue and platform engagement.

Phase 2 (Segmentation): City-wise performance and service popularity.

Phase 3 (Advanced): Month-over-Month (MoM) growth and Credit Risk Analysis (identifying users with pending balances).

Technical Skills Demonstrated
Advanced SQL: Joins, CTEs (WITH Clause), and Window Functions (LAG).

Data Integrity: Ensuring accurate calculations between usage and payment tables.

Problem Solving: Identifying business "pain points" like failed payments and inactive users.

How to Run This Project
Import the 4 CSV files into your PostgreSQL database.

Run the Project_dataset.sql file.
